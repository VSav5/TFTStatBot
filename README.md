### Description:
#### This project was created to mimic the Tracker.gg Twitch overlay for Teamfight Tactics.  I've played and watched TFT since it released and just recently wanted the overlay that many content creators for TFT have.  When I went to Tracker.gg to try and get it for myself, I found it was only an overlay for Twitch streams. So, frustrated, I decided to create one myself.     
#### The overlay is a translucent box that goes overtop of the game and sits at the top left of the window while displaying the users' various competetive stats including rank, league points, average score for the day.
